 PROPOSED SOLUTION 
 
 To address the challenge of real-time multilingual communication, the microservices-based architecture is proposed:
 
 Translation Service:
     - Translates messages in real-time between different languages.
     - Supports multiple languages and adapts based on user preferences.

 User authentication service:
     - Provides a robust, secure, and scalable user authentication system.

 Payment service:
     - This service integrates a payment gateway to facilitate subscription based financial transactions within the chat application.


This architecture ensures that real-time chat translation is accurate, efficient, and user-centric while remaining flexible for future enhancements.
